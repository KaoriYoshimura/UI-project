This is my Graphic Tool for UI Design school assignment.
The assignment was to build a landing page and one of the sub-pages based on my partnerâ€™s (alkanngo(https://github.com/alkanngo)) mockup.
The pages have been built to resemble the mockup as accurately as possible. The appearance is simple but includes several flexible box layouts which adapts depending on device-width.

*Browser compatibility was not a requirement, therefore I used clip path which is not supported by Internet Explorer.
